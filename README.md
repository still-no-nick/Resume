Frontend Developer
About Me

Frontend Developer with experience working across various methodologies: Kanban, Scrum, and Agile. I have gone through the full development lifecycle — from architecture design to feature release. My responsibilities included implementing complex UI logic, optimizing rendering performance, and improving web application load times. I have worked in teams ranging from 6 to 20+ people, have experience in technical leadership, and collaborated closely with stakeholders to gather and refine implementation requirements. I actively continue to grow my web development skills as well as my competencies as an architect and team lead.
